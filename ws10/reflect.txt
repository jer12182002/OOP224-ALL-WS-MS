1.if i put in the header, i dont need to give a function code in it. it is possible to fright a function header for the templated function. yes, i need to do itor i can also do it in the cpp file

2.sure we can do it, however we need the full prototype to make it work.

3.there will be no digit after that since the system compile will truncate it.

4. surly we can still finish it without anay template, however it will be lots work to do. since the template can take different types of data and handle them.

5.yes, they are working in the same way.
