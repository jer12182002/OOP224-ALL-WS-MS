1. it is in the String::String(int capacity) constructor. 
   surly it will work if i give more space to store the string.

2. my understanding is the library is more delicate than the standard. since doing our own libraries we need to follow more rules for override and put more logic.

3. since i dont touch anything from main function. so i dont think i have putted the safe empty state. but i do have a function is to check whether the string is empty.
 yes, i do clean up. since i put dynamic array in the construcoters so i deaccloacte the memory in the destructor.
 yes, i could, i did that in two ways. one is giving enough space and using strcpy method. another way is i literaly copy every single character in the string according to the index.
  i think what make it easier is doing the copy. before learning this. i used for loop to copy with single character. but now, its easier for me to use strcpy method.
